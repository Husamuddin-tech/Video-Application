# Video Application

## Overview

Welcome to the **Video Application** repositoryâ€”a backend-focused project developed using JavaScript. This application serves as a foundational learning tool for building a video-sharing platform, focusing on backend functionalities and server-side logic.

## Features

- **Video Upload & Storage**: Users can upload video files, which are stored securely for playback.
- **Video Streaming**: Stream videos directly from the platform with minimal buffering.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for user management.
- **Video Metadata Management**: Add titles, descriptions, and tags to videos for better organization.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Storage**: Local storage or cloud services (e.g., AWS S3)
- **Video Streaming**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or MP4 streaming

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud instance)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Husamuddin-tech/Video-Application.git
   cd Video-Application
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=8000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Usage

- **Upload Video**: Use API endpoints to upload video files along with metadata.
- **Stream Video**: Access video streams via provided endpoints.
- **User Authentication**: Use authentication endpoints to register or log in users.
